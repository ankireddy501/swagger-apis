The API notebooks are all executable! Hit "enter" in any code cell to execute it (and all cells before it that have not executed yet), or scroll to the bottom of the notebook and click "Play notebook". For more information, see [http://apinotebook.com](http://apinotebook.com).

#Considerations

- In order to run these notebooks you will need a Google account.
- You must also register a Google application as described at https://developers.google.com/console/help/new/#creatingdeletingprojects. Calendar and Mail API must be activated for your application (see https://developers.google.com/console/help/new/#activatingapis). Finally, you must generate client ID and client Secret for your application as described at https://developers.google.com/console/help/new/#generatingoauth2. At some point of notebook execution you will be prompted to enter your client ID and client secret.
