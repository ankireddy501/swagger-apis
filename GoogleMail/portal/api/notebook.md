#Considerations

- In order to run these notebooks you will need a GMail account. At some point of the excecution, you will be prompted to enter your GMail address.
- You must also register a Google application as described at https://developers.google.com/console/help/new/#creatingdeletingprojects. GMail API must be activated for your application (see [https://developers.google.com/console/help/new/#activatingapis](https://developers.google.com/console/help/new/#activatingapis)). Finally, you must generate client ID and client Secret for your application as described at [https://developers.google.com/console/help/new/#generatingoauth2](https://developers.google.com/console/help/new/#generatingoauth2). At some point of notebook execution you will be prompted to enter your client ID and client secret.
