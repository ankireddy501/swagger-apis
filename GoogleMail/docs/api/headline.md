The Gmail API is a RESTful API that can be used to access Gmail mailboxes and send mail. The API can be used by Gmail and Google Apps users alike as an alternative to IMAP. It is intended primarily for programmatic, batch mailbox access as a web service. The API supports many of the basic operations available through the Gmail user interface like reading, composing, and sending mail. It also lets you manage labels on threads and messages and query for specific messages and threads.
